# Calculator_backend

A simple calculator web app that calculates the sum of two numbers on the backend. 

This is a learning project part of [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/), whose purpose was to put into practice, my learnings of handling get and post requests using node.js and express.js. During this project I also learned to use the node package manager to add node packages to our web application.
